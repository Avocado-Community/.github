# Coding guidelines

If you plan to contribute to any repository under Avocado Comunity governance, please ensure to read carefully the following guidelines.

## General Guidelines

Zen of python can apply to any coding language and thus might be followed by any software developper:

> Beautiful is better than ugly.
> 
> Explicit is better than implicit.
> 
> Simple is better than complex.
> 
> Complex is better than complicated.
> 
> Flat is better than nested.
> 
> Sparse is better than dense.
> 
> Readability counts.
> 
> Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
> 
> Although practicality beats purity.
> 
> Errors should never pass silently.
> 
> Unless explicitly silenced.
> 
> In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
> 
> There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
> 
> Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
> 
> Now is better than never.
> 
> Although never is often better than right now.
> 
> If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
> 
> If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
> 
> Namespaces are one honking great idea â€“ let's do more of those!

Following this, general guidelines for code are presented below:

1. Make stuff clear and concise. This includes clear variable name and avoiding multiple logic layer when unnecessary.
2. First make a simple code that works as expected and then add functionality around to match expected results.
3. Respect SOLID principles
4. Always add comments when implementation purpose is not straightfoward to understand
5. Always add documentation along with your functions and classes

## Version Control Guidelines

### Commit Messages

Always use direct and understandable commit messages. Although, if the commit message you want to make is too long, maybe you should consider splitting the commit into smaller ones.

### Branch Naming

Name your new branches following this recommandations:

- if it concerns a new feature, use `feature-<feature-name>`
- if it concerns a fix for a bug issue, use `fix-issue-<issue-number>`
